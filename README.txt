hey thanks for checking this out!
---------------------------------
so here's some things you'll need before this will even work.

1. Latest Python

2. pycryptodome

3. Java (any newer version)

4. APKtool

5. Make sure you place the apk in the folder named APK_HERE

After this is installed just run the program and do your thing!

Make sure when saving levels you save them in the Decompile DataLocal path or there will be no change

Also (this is a HUGE thing) make sure you properly do the hex editing. When you open the hex editor
you may see blank spaces, you just need to fill them with 0's until it all lines up.
